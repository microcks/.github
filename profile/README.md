## ✨ Welcome to Microcks,

The open source, cloud native tool for API Mocking and Testing.
[Microcks](https://microcks.io/) is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation Sandbox](https://landscape.cncf.io/card-mode?selected=microcks) project 🚀

As numerous API styles and protocols coexist, there is a need for a uniform way to accelerate and secure their delivery! Our objective is to establish Microcks as the de-facto standard tool for delivering this unified approach [the open source way](https://www.theopensourceway.org/) 🙌

> 💡 **From day one, Microcks had the vision of a multi-protocol API ecosystem due to the ubiquitous nature of API. This is especially true at the enterprise level where the technology strata are built over the years.**

The most important aspect is testing your APIs consistently using [OpenAPI](https://microcks.io/documentation/using/openapi/), [AsyncAPI](https://microcks.io/documentation/using/asyncapi/), [SoapUI](https://microcks.io/documentation/using/soapui/), and [Postman Collections](https://microcks.io/documentation/using/postman/) across web, [gRPC](https://microcks.io/documentation/using/grpc/), [WebSockets](https://websockets.spec.whatwg.org/#the-websocket-interface), [GraphQL](https://microcks.io/documentation/using/graphql/), [Kafka](https://microcks.io/blog/apache-kafka-mocking-testing/), [NATS](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/nats-support/), [RabbitMQ](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/rabbitmq-support/), [MQTT](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/mqtt-support/), Google [PubSub](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/googlepubsub-support/), Amazon [SQS/SNS](https://microcks.io/documentation/guides/aws-sqs-sns-support/) and other popular patterns and protocols of your API lifecycle.
